# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a personal project of tic-tac-toe game I created while honing my skills in react following the [Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://react.devs/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

The game:

- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,

- Indicates when a player has won the game,

- Stores the game's history as a the game progresses,

- Allows players to review the game's history and see previous versions of the game's board.
